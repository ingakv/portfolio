# Portfolio

A collection of some of the work I have done over the course of my education in the last couple of years.



## Go game

A digitalized version of the game of [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), which simulates the gameplay with all of the features typically included in the game. The game is played with two players on one computer, and is coded in Haskell.



## Graphics programming

A directory including some of the work i did in the "Graphics programming" course. I made the framework myself from scratch in C++ and CMake. The labs include the work I made while actively learning, and the assignment and exam are the two bigger projects.

Assignment contains a simplified 3D version of chess, with all of the chess pieces having the same rules for movement.

The exam also contains a game on chessboard. The player should try to move boxes to marked target locations on the board. The locations of the player, the boxes, and target locations, as well as the board layout is randomized each time the game is launched.
